# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

`You should have the same Gemfile codes`
<details>
<summary>Gemfile.rb</summary>

```rb
# In /Gemfile.rb
source 'https://rubygems.org'

git_source(:github) do |repo_name|
  repo_name = "#{repo_name}/#{repo_name}" unless repo_name.include?("/")
  "https://github.com/#{repo_name}.git"
end


gem 'rails', '~> 5.1.4'
gem 'puma', '~> 3.7'
gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0'
gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0'
# gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby
gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.2'
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.5'
# gem 'redis', '~> 3.0'
# gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'
# gem 'capistrano-rails', group: :development

group :development, :test do
  gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.13'
  gem 'byebug', platforms: [:mri, :mingw, :x64_mingw]
  gem 'capybara', '~> 2.13'
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'
end

group :development do
  gem 'web-console', '>= 3.3.0'
  gem 'listen', '>= 3.0.5', '< 3.2'
  gem 'spring'
  gem 'spring-watcher-listen', '~> 2.0.0'
end

group :test do
  gem 'rails-controller-testing', '1.0.2'
  gem 'minitest-reporters',       '1.1.14'
  gem 'guard',                    '2.13.0'
  gem 'guard-minitest',           '2.4.4'
end

group :production do
  gem 'pg', '0.21.0'
end

gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
```

We will install the local gems while suppressing the installation of production gems using the --without production option

```scss
// TYPE IN TERMINAL

$ bundle install --without production
```

> This arranges to skip the pg gem for PostgreSQL in development and use SQLite for development and testing.

> `Heroku recommends against using different databases in development and production`, but for the sample application it won’t make any difference, and SQLite is much easier than PostgreSQL to install and configure locally.

> `In case you’ve previously installed a version of a gem` (such as Rails itself) other than the one specified by the Gemfile, `it’s a good idea to update the gems with bundle update` to make sure the versions match.

```scss
// TYPE IN TERMINAL

$ bundle update
```
